Hello! Thank you for coming by, and I pre-emptively apologize for my inability to be concise. I promise my papers read less rambly than this page.

Currently, I work with [Pratyush Tiwary](https://sites.google.com/site/pratyushtiwary/) at the Institute of Physical Science and Technology in Maryland, where we attempt to conquer the world with AI augmented enhanced sampling. Specifically, we are hunting cryptic pockets by exploring the structural diversity of biomolecules.

By late September 2023, I will be leaving for the bay area to work as a Machine Learning scientist for [Prescient Design at Genentech inc.](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design). Ironically, I haven't predicted the specifics of my new research.

Background
-----

Before I started fiddling with neural networks, I was, and will always be a theoretical molecular biophysicist. I learnt how to be this from my PhD advisor [Aaron Dinner](https://dinner-group.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. [Jonathan Weare](https://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/) at the Courant Institute in New York co-advised me and gave me some applied math chops as well.

Even before that, I went to college at IIT Bombay, where I might have learnt a few things, and also read the book "What is Life?" by Erwin Schrodinger and was more influenced by it than anyone should be by a book. I decided my life will be dedicated to understanding the physics of biology, so here we are.

Other Stuff
------
I also enjoy reading, trying and cooking interesting food, boardgames, long walks, and dogs. Especially dogs.
