I am a mathematician by training, pursuing research in mechanistic interpretability. I believe AGI research has the potential to be dangerous, and the most effective preventative measure is a clear framework for understanding the internal workings of the underlying machinery.

Currently, I am an AI and topology consultant for Garoux LLC, and I am also working with [Prof. Tom Goldstein](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) at University of Maryland.

Background
======
I have a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park. While I originally worked on algebraic geometry and topology, my [thesis](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/29249) was on computational topology, where I proved an approximation theorem on persistent homology with relevance to dimension reduction.

Before graduate school, I did economic consulting at LECG, and before that I was a math and econ major at Swarthmore College. I grew up in New York and Salt Lake City, Utah.

Site guide
------
On this site, you can also find [my CV](link), some [writing](link) on AGI and interpretability.

Other Stuff
------
I also enjoy boardgames, reading, classical music, good food, long walks, and dogs. Especially dogs.
