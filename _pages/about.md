I am a mathematician by training, pursuing research in mechanistic interpretability. I believe AGI research has the potential to be dangerous, and the most effective preventative measure is a clear mathematical framework for understanding the internal workings of the underlying machinery.

Currently, I am an AI and topology consultant for FILLBYNATHANIEL, and I am also working with [Prof. Tom Goldstein](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) on FILLBYN.

Background
======
I have a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park. While originally trained in theoretical topology, my eventual thesis was on computational topology, where I proved a convergence law for errors accumulated through dimensional reduction. [This](internallinktoapageonthiswebsite.com) is a brief summary, and the full length thesis can be found [here](linktothesis.com).

Before graduate school, I worked at FILLBYNATHANIEL, and before that I was a math and econ major at Swarthmore College. I grew up in New York and Salt Lake City, Utah.

Site guide
------
On this site, you can also find [my CV](link), some [writing](link) on AGI and interpretability.

Other Stuff
------
I also enjoy boardgames, reading, classical music, good food, long walks, and dogs. Especially dogs.
