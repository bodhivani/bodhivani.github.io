This page is obviously incomplete, but there is little I care about as much as supporting young women in STEM. If you want to collaborate on outreach projects, want some help here and there, or are yourself a budding female scientist, email me and I will definitely respond.
Try to use a subject line that makes this clear, e.g. WiTCh (Women in Theoretical Chemistry)

Eventually, this page will contain:

1. Some of my favourite "problems" I recommend for people interested in the kind of things I do, some made up, some borrowed from here and there.

2. Outreach stories

3. Enhanced sampling code and tutorials
